# Introduction

To get started, you need an activated [Filen account](https://app.filen.io/#/register).  
(Filen accounts are always free and offer 10GB of storage space)

Secondly, you need a computer or laptop with a suitable operating system such as  
64-bit Windows 10 or greater, macOS 11 or greater or common Linux distributions.

**We also recommend that you have at least 4GB of RAM and a CPU with 2 GHz or more.**

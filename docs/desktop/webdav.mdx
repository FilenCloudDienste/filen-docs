# Hosting a local WebDAV server

You can also start a locally hosted WebDAV server.

**Since everything is end-to-end encrypted and we do not host this for you to maintain and guarantee the encryption, this must be hosted locally yourself.**

To enable the local WebDAV server, you should first have a brief look into the following options:

-   **Enabled**  
     This option starts or stops the local WebDAV instance.  
     However, you should first take a look at the following options and set them if necessary.
-   **HTTP Protocol**  
     Here you can choose between the unsecured HTTP protocol or the secured HTTPS protocol.
    If possible, HTTPS should be selected.
-   **Hostname**  
    The hostname determines which local address can be used to access the WebDAV instance.
-   **Port**  
     Here you can specify a specific port that should apply to the WebDAV server.
-   **Authentication mode**  
     Here you can select the authentication mode between **Basic** and **Digest**.
-   **Username**  
    Here you can select a username to connect to the local WebDAV server.
-   **Password**  
     Here you can select a password to connect to the local WebDAV server.

Once you have set everything according to your preferences, you can start or stop the  
local WebDAV server with the first option.

On the left sidebar, you'll see various options and quick access tabs which we will shortly discuss further.  
Everything on the right of the sidebar is your currently empty cloud interface "Files Section" where you will see your files and folders in the future.

At the top center you can see a search bar to search your files in the currently opened folder.

On the top right hand side you will see a button called "New"

If you click on your profile picture, you will be taken to your account settings.

In the **Notes** tab, you can view existing notes or create new ones.

When clicking on the plus icon in the top right corner, you can directly create a new note in the following formats:

-   Text (.txt)
-   Checklist
-   Markdown (.md)
-   Code (various code languages are supported)
-   Rich text (.rtf)

Pressing and holding a note opens the following quick action window:

-   **Select**  
     This selects one or more notes for quick actions such as pinning, moving, etc.
-   **History**  
     All previous versions of a note can be displayed here and also reset.
-   **Participants**  
     All participants of a note are displayed here but you can also add additional contacts here.
-   **Type**  
     Here, the note can also be changed to a different format.
-   **Pinned**  
     You can pin the note to the top of the list here.
-   **Favorited**  
     Here, the note can be tagged as a favorite for quick access.
-   **Rename**  
     As the option name suggests, the note name can be changed here.
-   **Duplicate**  
     For example, if you want to make changes to a note and do not want to use the original, you can duplicate the note here.
-   **Export**  
     With this option, the note can be exported directly to your local device in the appropriate format.
-   **Archive**  
    If you want the note to disappear from view but not be deleted, you can simply archive it here.
-   **Trash**  
     When a note is moved to the trash, it remains there for 30 days like normal data before being automatically deleted entirely.  
    Manual deletion beforehand is also no problem here.

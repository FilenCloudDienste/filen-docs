As you can see in the image, there are various settings options available there.

-   **Enabled**  
     Here you can enable or disable the automatic camera upload.
-   **Albums**  
     Here you can select or deselect all your local albums that will be included in the upload.
-   **Cloud directory**  
     this is your cloud destination folder, where everything will be uploaded to.
-   **Videos**  
     This will enable or disable the upload of video files in general.
-   **Cellular**  
     Here you can choose whether to upload using your mobile data or only via Wi-Fi to save data.
-   **Background**  
     This option is important so that the upload can continue in the background, i.e. when the app is not in focus.
-   **Low battery**  
     If your battery is almost empty, the upload will stop so as not to drain your smartphone even more.
-   **Compress**  
    When compression is enabled, the data is uploaded with JPG 80% lossless compression.

This is how the **Photos** tab will look like, if something has been linked and uploaded

# Chats

The chat section is relatively simple and quick to explain.  
You generally have a complete overview of all chats at a glance.

You can use the search bar to find something quickly or click on the plus icon on the top right to create a new conversation and add one or more users to the new conversation.

By long pressing on a conversation, you also have the following options:

-   **Participants**  
     Add or remove other **Filen** users to the conversation.
-   **Muted**  
     This will enable or disable chat notifications.
-   **Rename**  
     The general name of the conversation can be changed here.
-   **Delete**  
     The conversation can be either be left or deleted here.

It should be self-explanatory that a chat only works with another Filen user and the existing email address.

By pressing on the 3 dots in the top right corner, you will have the same options as long pressing on the conversation in the **Chats** tab.

-   **Change Password**  
     Here you can change your password. To do so, you will need your current password and then a new one.
-   **Two Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
    Here you can and should also activate 2FA. You will see a QR code, which you can scan with a corresponding 2FA app.  
    The 2FA app will then give you a code with at least 6 digits, which you must enter here for confirmation.  
    After that, you will need the 2FA code every time you log in.
-   **Biometric authentication**  
     With biometric authentication, you can secure the Filen app with FaceID or fingerprint recognition, for example.  
     As a backup, you must set a PIN in case it doesn't work.

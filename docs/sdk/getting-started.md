# Getting started

## Installation

You can install the SDK using the NPM registry and your favorite package manager.

`npm install @filen/sdk@latest`

The SDK requires a Node.js compatible JavaScript runtime. For use in a web browser you'll need a bundler (Vite for example) and provide node polyfills. You can refer to our official [web app's vite config](https://github.com/FilenCloudDienste/filen-web/blob/d32befa16ede6a23eb1a5ec94c1864b468f4b984/vite.config.ts#L18).

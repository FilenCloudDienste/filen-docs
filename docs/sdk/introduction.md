# Introduction

## About the SDK

The TypeScript SDK is used by our first-party clients, and it is publicly documented to enable external developers to build their own clients and other third-party applications on top of Filen.

The TypeScript SDK can do everything our first-party clients can, which includes uploading and downloading files, managing files and directories, sharing items, accessing notes and contacts, having chat conversations, managing user-specific settings, and more.

## How these docs are structured

In the following guides you will learn everything you need to know to access Filen in your own applications. The _Guides_ will walk you through authentication, how to properly encrypt and decrypt data, and how to upload and download files. Refer to the _Endpoints_ for detailed information about the available API endpoints, which includes more features such as sharing, notes, contacts, chats, and other.

## More information

If you need more in depth information about implemented functions and their types, please refer the [generated SDK docs](https://sdk-ts-docs.filen.io/classes/FilenSDK.html).
These docs will help you get a better understanding of how the SDK works internally.

# Introduction

The Filen CLI provides a set of useful tools for interacting with the cloud:
- [Accessing your Filen Drive](./cli/access-filen-drive) in a stateless environment or [interactive mode](./cli/access-filen-drive#interactive-mode)
- [Syncing](./cli/syncing) locations with the cloud (just like the Desktop app)
- Mounting a [network drive](./cli/network-drive-mounting)
- Running a [WebDAV mirror server](./cli/webdav-and-s3-server#webdav-server) of your [personal drive](./cli/webdav-and-s3-server#single-user), or multiple drives in [proxy mode](./cli/webdav-and-s3-server#proxy-mode)
- Running an [S3 mirror server](./cli/webdav-and-s3-server#s3-server)

:::warning Work in progress

The CLI is still work in progress. Do not use it in production yet. It is not guaranteed to be stable.

## Installation and updates

You can download the latest binaries from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/FilenCloudDienste/filen-cli/releases/latest).
Docker images are also available as [`filen/cli`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/filen/cli).

The Filen CLI includes an automatic updater that checks for a new release every time the CLI is invoked
(after checking for updates, it will not check again for the next 10 minutes).
Invoke the CLI with the `--skip-update` flag to skip checking for updates.
(Use the `--force-update` flag to check for updates even if it was recently checked.)


## Usage

Global flags:
- `--help`, `-h`: display usage information
- `--verbose`, `-v`: display additional information
- `--quiet`, `-q`: hide things like progress bars and additional logs
- `--log-file <file>`: write logs to a file

For detailed information on how to use the CLI features, see the respective documentation pages.

# Authenticating

There are several ways to authenticate the Filen CLI. 

Generally, if you have 2FA enabled and don't specify a 2FA code, you will be prompted for it.

#### Keep me signed in

Invoke the CLI and specify your Filen email and password. You can then choose to save them in a local encrypted configuration file. You can delete them later using `filen delete-credentials`.

#### Arguments

Invoke the CLI with the `--email` and `--password` (optionally `--two-factor-code`) arguments set.

#### Environment variables

Put your credentials in the `FILEN_EMAIL` and `FILEN_PASSWORD` (optionally `FILEN_2FA_CODE`) environment variables.

#### Credentials from file

Store your Filen email and password in a file named `.filen-cli-credentials` where you invoke the CLI. Put your email and password in separate lines, in plain text (optionally 2FA code in third line).

#### Auth config

Export an "auth config" (which includes your Filen email, password and other details) using `filen export-auth-config`.
This will produce a file named `.filen-cli-auth-config`, which you need to place where you invoke the CLI from.
This option can be useful especially for clustered WebDAV/S3 servers, where otherwise too many login requests result in rate limiting.

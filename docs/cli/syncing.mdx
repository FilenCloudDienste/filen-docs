# Syncing

```
$ filen sync [sync pairs...] [--continuous]
```

Invoke `filen sync` to sync any locations with your Filen Drive. This is the same functionality you get with the Desktop app.

You must specify the sync pairs (`[sync pairs...]` above) as follows:

-   **(central registry)** `filen sync`: Read the sync pairs from `syncPairs.json` (inside the [data dir](/docs/cli#data-directory)).
    This file must contain JSON of the type `{local: string, remote: string, syncMode: string, alias?: string, disableLocalTrash?: boolean, ignore?: string[], excludeDotFiles?: boolean}[]` (this is a [TypeScript type definition](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html), where `?` means an optional field). See [below](#sync-modes) for `syncMode` values.
-   **(custom registry)** `filen sync <file>`: Read the sync pairs from a custom JSON file (same type as above).
-   **(aliases)** `filen sync mypair myotherpair`: Sync the sync pairs from the central registry that were given the aliases `mypair` and `myotherpair`.
-   **(literal pair)** `filen sync /local/path:twoWay:/cloud/path`: Sync the local path `/local/path` with the cloud path `/cloud/path` in two-way sync.
-   **(shorthand for two-way pairs)** `filen sync /local:/cloud`: Sync `/local` with `/cloud` in two-way sync.
-   **(other sync modes and abbreviations)** `filen sync /local1:localToCloud:/cloud1 /local2:ltc:/cloud2`: Sync `/local1` with `/cloud1` (and `/local2` with `/cloud2`) in local-to-cloud sync. See [below](#sync-modes) for more abbreviations.
-   **(disable local trash)** `filen sync /local:/cloud --disable-local-trash`: Disable local trash

You can set the `--continuous` flag to keep syncing (instead of only syncing once).

Example of sync pairs registry:

```json
[
	{
		"local": "/home/user/Pictures",
		"remote": "/Pictures",
		"syncMode": "cloudBackup"
	},
	{
		"local": "/home/user/Documents",
		"remote": "/Documents",
		"syncMode": "twoWay",
		"alias": "documents",
		"disableLocalTrash": true,
		"ignore": ["example.txt", "*.log"],
		"excludeDotFiles": true
	}
]
```

Note that since this is a JSON file, backslashes (`\`) in strings need to be escaped, e. g. `"C:\\some\\path"`).


### Sync Modes

-   **Two Way** (`twoWay`, `tw`)  
    Mirror every action in both directions.  
    _Renaming, deleting & moving is applied to both sides._
-   **Local to Cloud** (`localToCloud`, `ltc`)  
    Mirror every action done locally to the cloud but never act on cloud changes.  
    _Renaming, deleting & moving is only transferred to the cloud, but not the other way around._
-   **Local Backup** (`localBackup`, `lb`)  
    Only upload data to the cloud, never delete anything or act on cloud changes.  
    _Renaming & moving is transferred to the cloud, but not local deletions._
-   **Cloud To Local** (`cloudToLocal`, `ctl`)  
    Mirror every action done in the cloud locally but never act on local changes.  
    _Renaming, deleting & moving is only transferred to the local side, but not the other way around._
-   **Cloud Backup** (`cloudBackup`, `cb`)  
    Only download data from the cloud, never delete anything or act on local changes.  
    _Renaming & moving is transferred to the local side, but not cloud deletions._

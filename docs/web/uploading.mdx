# Uploading Files

To upload a file, click the "Upload files" button or drag and drop files directly into your still empty files section.

-   Select the files you want to upload from your computer.
-   Click "Select" or "Upload" to start the upload process.
-   Filen will display a progress bar, as soon as the process is complete, the uploaded files are listed.

Once you have uploaded your first file, you will have 4 options for uploading files.

-   Right-click anywhere in your files section, in the drop-down menu that appears you have the option to select files or directories from your computer and upload them.
-   Click on the "New" button in the top right corner. There you have the same options as point 1.
-   Drag & Drop: Drag files directly from your computer into the files section by holding down your left mouse button.  
    Release the file and it will automatically upload.
-   Set up synchronizations with your Filen Desktop Client and upload files automatically

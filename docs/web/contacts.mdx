# Contacts

**What are contacts and how do I navigate them?**

Use the Filen Contacts to connect with friends, family, work colleagues or anyone else. They are the basic building block for shared notes, chats, data exchange in groups and much more.

Navigate to the "Contacts" tab in the left side column of your web drive and click on it.

You will now see different tabs at the top of the screen.

-   **Online** See which of your added contacts are currently online to reply to you.
-   **All** See all your contacts whether online or offline.
-   **Offline** See all your contacts who are currently offline. They will be notified the next time you log in if you still write to them.
-   **Request** See incoming pending friend/contact requests.
-   **Pending** See outgoing pending friend/contact requests.
-   **Blocked** See all users you have blocked.

# How do I add new contacts?

# How do I remove contacts?

Here you can write content in your notes.

New notes are automatically named with the current date and time.

# How do I edit notes?

You can customize the name of your note by left clicking on the name of the note in question.

You can edit your note by right-clicking on a note in the left column or by pressing the three dots at the top right next to your profile picture.
